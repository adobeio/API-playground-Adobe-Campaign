# Adobe Campaign Standard API Playground
  This is a simple app that you can run locally to talk to your ACS instance!

# How does it work

## Create Campaign Integration on Adobe I/O
  Follow this doc to create a Campaign Integration. Once your integration has been created (it should look something like this picture below) and you have your private key in hand. You are ready to play with the website!
  https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/standard/en/api/ACS_API.html#adobeio-configuration

## Clone repo and run it!
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  $ npm start
  ```
  Now if you go to https://localhost:3000, you should be able to see this view. Follow the instruction, paste in your credentials (which can be found in your I/O integration), and you are ready to start!
